    "Radix-2 DIT FFT was invented by Cooley and Tukey in 1965. It's widely used in digital signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the problem into smaller subproblems. The complexity is O(N log N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Radix-2 means that the number of points is a power of 2. DIT is Decimation In Time, means that the input is decimated in time domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "One representation of the polynomial is using coefficient form. Such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3$\n",

    "4 points are enough to represent a polynomial of degree 3. From previous section, we know that $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 6. So we need at least 7 points to represent $h(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of polynomial multiplication in point-value form is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the fields of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to at least 7 points.\n",
    "2. Compute the point-value form of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n",
